        <p>
            This tasty, cat-friendly omelette is the purr-fect way for your furry companion to start the day! It makes good use of shredded carrots, which contain healthy beta-carotene.
            The eggs and cottage cheese add a bit of protein, and the cottage cheese is also low in lactose, making it easier for your kitty to digest.

    <ul>
        <li>3 medium eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cottage cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of carrots (when grated)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Cut the carrots into 1/4 inch slices and add to boiling water. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until tender. Cut or shred into small pieces when done.</li>
        <li>While the carrots are cooking, combine the eggs and water and beat well.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs in a non-stick pan (to avoid using butter or oil). Cook on medium-low heat until done.</li>
        <li>Flip over like a pancake and spread the cottage cheese and veggies over half of the cooked surface. Fold like an omelet. Cool and cut to bite-sized pieces to serve.</li>
