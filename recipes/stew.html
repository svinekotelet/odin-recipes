        <p>This chicken and vegetable stew is so tasty that you might just find yourself tempted to steal some of your cats dinner (not recommended)! The chicken provides an excellent source of the animal
            protein that cats need as obligate carnivores, and the veggies are all cat-friendly and packed with vitamins. This one is sure to be a hit with your feline companion,
            and the recipe makes enough for several meals.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken (preferably "free-range" or packaged with "no hormones or antibiotics" on the label)</li>
            <li>2 cups brown rice</li>
            <li>6 stalks celery</li>
            <li>8 carrots (scrubbed but not peeled)</li>
            <li>2 or 3 yellow squash</li>
            <li>2 or 3 zucchini</li>
            <li>1 small broccoli crown</li>
            <li>1 handful of green beans or peas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash chicken, then cover with water in a large stew pot.</li>
            <li>Cut vegetables into pieces and add to pot. </li>
            <li>Add rice.</li>
            <li>Cook until chicken almost falls off the bone and vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Completely debone the chicken. This is extremely important, as cooked chicken bones can splinter and cause serious intestinal damage.</li>
            <li>Pour the stew into a blender and blend or chop until mixture is coarse (about bite-sized).</li>
            <li>Serve and freeze remainder in meal-sized plastic bags.</li>
        </ol>
