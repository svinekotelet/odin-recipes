    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all spice rub ingredients and whisk to combine. Thouroughly dry ribs and remove membrane.
            Coat ribs liberally with spice rub, making sure to get every nook and cranny. 
            Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours, up to overnight. 
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large saucepan, combine ingredients for BBQ sauce. Whisk to combine.
            Cook at a bare simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until thick. Can be made ahead of time - 
            reheat before using. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Set up a gas or charcoal grill with a <em>two-zone fire</em>, where one half of the grill is under 
            direct flame, and the other side is not. Target temperature for the cooler side should be 225F-250F.
        </li>
        <li>Put wood chips in a smoker box or a simple tin foil pouch and place under the grill grate, on the 
            hot side of the grill. 
        </li>
        <li>Once smoke appears, place ribs on the cool side of the grill. Maintain temperature for 
            3 hours, spraying down frequently with apple juice to keep ribs moist, and reapplying more wood chips as 
            needed/desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            After three hours, or once ribs reach internal temperature of 160F remove ribs from heat and wrap tightly with tin foil. Optionally, 
            place remaining apple juice in the pouch with the ribs to provide extra moisture. Place wrapped ribs back onto cool side of grill.
            Cook at same temperature of 225F-250F for 2 more hours, or until ribs reach internal temperature of 200F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unwrap ribs and place back on grill. Baste liberally with BBQ sauce. Optionally, refill smoke box one last time for extra smoky flavor. 
            Frequently reapply sauce over the next hour. If desired, turn heat up slightly to help sear sauce towards end of cook time. Cook until 
            ribs reach internal temperature of at least 203F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove ribs from grill and allow to rest for 10 minutes, tenting loosely with foil. Serve and enjoy!
